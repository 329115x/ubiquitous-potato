      <title>Request for Proposal for Global Consumer Survey</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2014-07-16-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (&quot;ICANN&quot;) is seeking one or more providers to conduct a global survey assessing aspects of consumer trust and perceived consumer choice and the Internet domain name system (DNS). The selected provider(s) will design and execute an initial survey to create a meaningful baseline of data on consumer attitudes and will perform a follow-on survey one year later, to generate a set of comparison data. ICANN is seeking qualified providers to manage this set of complex survey activities in a timely and efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is intended to contribute to one of the reviews mandated by ICANN's &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/pages/affirmation-of-commitments-2009-09-30-en&quot;&gt;Affirmation of Commitments&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;Affirmation&quot;). The Affirmation outlines ICANN's responsibilities to the global community of Internet users, who are all served by the DNS. The Affirmation focuses on three primary areas of accountability: (a) ensuring accountability, transparency and the interests of global Internet users; (b) preserving security, stability and resiliency of the DNS; and (c) promoting competition, consumer trust and consumer choice. Each of the focus areas includes regular reviews by the community to gauge ICANN's performance. The survey will serve as one source of data to inform the analysis of how the New gTLD Program has promoted competition, consumer trust and consumer choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer survey will capture some of the metrics proposed by ICANN's community members Â from the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) and the At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC) to evaluate the impact of the New gTLD Program on competition, consumer trust and consumer choice. A review team, to be formed, will include the survey results as it examines other measures, such as the geographic spread of new gTLD registrations, the number of internationalized domain names (IDNs or domains in scripts that include characters outside the letters a-z, numbers 0-9 and a hyphen) available, and the relative incidence of compliance complaints, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the DNS is relevant to all Internet users worldwide, the survey must be globally representative of all geographic regions, and thus the selected provider(s) must be able to conduct its work across multiple countries and languages. The proposed methodology must also be replicable one year after the initial survey is conducted to measure changes in attitudes as new gTLDs become more prominent in the domain name space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information and instructions for submitting responses please click &lt;a href=&quot;/en/system/files/files/rfp-global-consumer-survey-16jul14-en.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; [ZIP, 1.08 MB].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals should be submitted to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:globalconsumersurvey-rfp@icann.org&quot;&gt;globalconsumersurvey-rfp@icann.org&lt;/a&gt; by 23:59 UTC ON 6 August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revised Enhancing ICANN Accountability: Process and Next Steps</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2014-10-10-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ICANN today published &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/pages/process-next-steps-2014-10-10-en&quot;&gt;Revised Enhancing ICANN Accountability: Process and Next Steps&lt;/a&gt;, a document that describes the process to examine how, from an organizational perspective, ICANN's accountability mechanisms should be strengthened to address the absence of its historical relationship with the U.S. Government. This revision incorporates comments from a further &lt;a href=&quot;/public-comments/enhancing-accountability-2014-09-05-en&quot;&gt;21-day comment period&lt;/a&gt; from 6-27 September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate and apologize that this is being posted so close to the ICANN meeting. However, we wanted to provide the revised process to the community so it is available for the ICANN 51 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 14 March 2014 the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2014/ntia-announces-intent-transition-key-internet-domain-name-functions&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its intent to transition its stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions to the global multistakeholder community. NTIA asked ICANN, as the IANA functions contractor and global coordinator for the Domain Name System (DNS), to convene a multistakeholder process to develop a proposal for the transition, which would end ICANN's contractual relationship with the U.S. Government that has existed since 1998. That historical relationship has been perceived as a backstop with regard to ICANN's organization-wide accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN received &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.icann.org/lists/comments-enhancing-accountability-06sep14/&quot;&gt;17 comments&lt;/a&gt; during the 21-day further comment period. Based on the input received, ICANN proposes integrating the originally proposed two-group structure into a single Cross Community Working Group (CCWG), in reflection of the strong community support for the CCWG model. Additionally, given the input over the course of the discussions on this process, it's suggested that the CCWG has two work steams: one focused on accountability in light of ICANN's changing historical relationship with the U.S. Government; and the second, on the broader accountability issues the community would like to bring to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Revised Enhancing ICANN Accountability: Process and Next Steps document can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/pages/process-next-steps-2014-10-10-en&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;/en/system/files/files/process-next-steps-pdf-10oct14-en.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;, 350 KB]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Summary Report of Public Comments received on the proposed process can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/en/system/files/files/report-comments-enhancing-accountability-10oct14-en.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; [PDF. 506 KB].&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>U.S. Commerce Secretary Pledges to Protect a Free and Open Internet</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2014-10-13-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, addressing attendees at the opening ceremony of ICANN's 51&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; public meeting in Los Angeles, declared unwavering support for the United States government's decision to transfer stewardship of the IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community and not to any one single organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me be clear about this. The United States will not allow the global Internet to be co-opted by any person, entity or nation seeking to substitute their parochial world view for the collective wisdom of this community,&quot; said Pritzker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,300 members of the global multistakeholder community have come together in Los Angeles, California, for ICANN's 51&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; public meeting to discuss the future of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we don't strive to improve our governance and accountability at all times, and especially this time, we will not gain and maintain the confidence of the world,&quot; said Fadi ChehadÃ©, President and CEO of ICANN. &quot;ICANN's leadership, the ICANN board and the ICANN community are committed to the best possible governance and accountability mechanisms there are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN Board Chair Dr. Stephen Crocker spoke about ICANN's priorities, saying, &quot;Throughout the organization we are sincerely concerned about transparency, about accountability, and we work assiduously trying to improve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IANA Stewardship Coordination Group (ICG) will be meeting during the week to continue their discussion on how the NTIA will go about transitioning its stewardship of the IANA functions to the Internet community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have to get this transition right,&quot; said Pritzker. &quot;Make no mistake: I stand by ICANN. I am all in when it comes to the global debate over Internet governance. And we will preserve and protect a free and open Internet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those attending ICANN51 or participating remotely are highly encouraged to join and watch the ICG's meeting. Details for doing so can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://la51.icann.org/en/schedule/fri-icg&quot;&gt;http://la51.icann.org/en/schedule/fri-icg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN also announced the winner of the 2014 Leadership Award &amp;ndash; Jonathan Robinson, Chair of the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO). The Leadership Award recognizes ICANN community members who demonstrate leadership in protecting and promoting the multistakeholder model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GNSO recommends changes to existing policy and develops new policy for generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs). To learn more about the GNSO, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://gnso.icann.org/en/&quot;&gt;http://gnso.icann.org/en/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ICANN CEO Congratulates Newly Elected ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2014-10-23-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fadi ChehadÃ©, The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has extended his congratulations and best wishes to the newly elected Secretary-General of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Houlin Zhao on his election as the ITU Secretary-General,&quot; said ChehadÃ©. &quot;His global support was punctuated by the fact that he obtained 152 votes of the 156 countries that were present and voting in the election.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhao will succeed current ITU Secretary-General Dr. Hamadoun Toure in January and ChehadÃ© made a point of underscoring Dr. Toure's contributions to enhancing lines of communication with ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are grateful to Dr. Toure for the bridges he helped build between the ITU and ICANN,&quot; said ChehadÃ©. &quot;Our interactions have been built on a foundation of mutual respect and a shared belief that the Internet has an increasingly important role in global socioeconomic development. We are enthused at the prospect of continuing those efforts with Houlin Zhao.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IANA Stewardship Transition Cross Community Working Group (CWG) on Naming Related Functions</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2014-11-28-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chairs' Statement with progress update and route ahead&lt;br/&gt;Lise Fuhr &amp;amp;  Jonathan Robinson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on  from the face-to-face meeting of the Community Working Group (CWG) on Naming  Related Functions in Frankfurt, Germany on 19 â 20 November 2014, the CWG has  continued to make good progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial  draft of the Proposal from the CWG was published on the CWG mailing list on 26  November 2014 and this was discussed by the CWG in a scheduled meeting on 27  November 2014. The meeting had a number of points on the agenda but focussed  substantially on two key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RFP3 -  The content of the initial draft proposal from the CWG which relates to item 3  in the request for proposals from the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination  Group (ICG).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key  questions / issues to be addressed in public comment - the prospective specific  questions or issues that the CWG would like to see addressed as part of the  public comment on the draft proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also  discussed that while the initial draft proposal from the CWG represents a good  platform on which to build, there remains significant opportunity for  refinement and development by the CWG based on a range of inputs including that  from the public comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that  the key building blocks are in place to produce a timely response to the ICG  RFP but recognise the need to remain vigilant on all aspects of the timetable  and project plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindful of the  timetable, the next steps in the process are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: upper-alpha;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify  proposed changes in the initial draft of the Proposal from the CWG by 12h00 UTC  in 29 November 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate  changes into the initial draft of the Proposal from the CWG such that it  becomes a draft of the Proposal from the CWG published for public comment on 1  December 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue  to work as a CWG in parallel with public comment period including developing  areas of the document relating to items 4, 5 &amp;amp; 6 of the RFP from the ICG.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognise  that final substantial inputs to the proposal will need to be complete by the  end of the weekend of 10/11 January 2015 such that the week following is  focussed solely on refining the proposal document.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure  widespread awareness of the draft and the key milestones of the CWG including  ensuring that all chartering organisations recognise the 19-30 January 2015 time  slot for approving the proposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also note  that a particular area of attention for the CWG is to ensure effective  coordination with the parallel and related process on enhancing ICANN  accountability. To that end, the CWG co-chairs met on 28 November 2014 with the  co-chairs of the drafting team on Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) on  Enhancing ICANN Accountability, at least one of whom (Thomas Rickert) we  understand will remain as a co-chair of the CCWG on Enhancing ICANN  Accountability. Recognising that the two cross community groups are at  different points in their work, it was discussed that the CWG on Naming Related  Functions could make a contribution to the CCWG on Accountability by assisting  to identify accountability mechanisms that are necessary conditions for the  stewardship transition. To this end, we (the co-chairs of the CWG) plan to work  with our CWG to identify such necessary conditions for transmission to the CCWG  on Accountability in order to assist their work and moreover, to coordinate  with the co-chairs of the CCWG on Accountability on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CWG-Stewardship Chairs' Statement - Weekend Sessions 10-11 January 2015</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2015-01-12-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cross Community Working Group (CWG) on Naming Related Functions held an intensive work weekend on 10-11 January 2015. The weekend comprised four, two-hour virtual meetings held over two days, equivalent to one month of full CWG meetings and had a significant focus on input received from public comments on the draft proposal. The CWG is fully aware of the value of the contribution provided by the comprehensive and thoughtful &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.icann.org/lists/comments-cwg-naming-transition-01dec14/&quot;&gt;public comments&lt;/a&gt; it received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When originally scheduled, the work weekend was envisaged as a time to finalize the basis of the CWG proposal in order for the proposal to be prepared for submission to the five chartering organizations (ALAC, ccNSO, GAC, GNSO, and SSAC) and thereafter, to the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) as part of the overall &lt;a href=&quot;/stewardship&quot;&gt;IANA Stewardship Transition&lt;/a&gt; process. However, considering the diversity of comments received during the public comment period on the draft proposal, it became apparent to the CWG that more work was needed to review and refine the proposal on the back of these. As such, the weekend's focus was on further processing of the public comment input and identifying areas of commonality within the CWG, using tools such as polls and surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the weekend, the CWG conducted two &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.icann.org/display/gnsocwgdtstwrdshp/Current+Drafts&quot;&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; of the whole group in order to get a high-level sense of the group's views regarding different suggestions made in the submissions from the public comment period. The surveys were based on suggestions arising from the public comment submissions, as well as additional, related questions. The results of the survey were used to guide the CWG in considering the public comments and continuing its work toward development of a final proposal for submission to the ICG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Developments from the Weekend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the weekend served to hone a range of details within the CWG proposal and to review the original timeline that the CWG agreed to in October. The group also specifically addressed issues related to accountability in order to best assist in the further development of the related work of the CCWG on Enhancing ICANN Accountability (CCWG-Accountability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings were recorded and transcribed and are available on the group's &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.icann.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=51415494&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, along with the documents presented and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.icann.org/display/gnsocwgdtstwrdshp/Draft+Proposal&quot;&gt;survey results&lt;/a&gt;. A quick analysis of the survey results was done in preparation for the weekend and a summary of the findings was presented to the CWG and then systematically discussed by the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to the link to the CCWG-Accountability, the CWG worked to develop further input for the CCWG-Accountability ahead of their upcoming meeting in Frankfurt, Germany on 19-20 January 2015. In addition, the group began to identify components of the CWG proposal that are likely to be contingent on key areas of the CCWG-Accountability work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In striving to develop a consensus proposal, the CWG will now need to consider and integrate the outcome of the weekend sessions as well as focus on the critical next steps required. Key next steps include; obtaining legal advice on relevant elements of the proposal and further engagement with the CCWG-Accountability, as well as informing and preparing to seek support from the Chartering Organizations, all of which we recognize will affect the current timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About the CWG&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CWG began its work in October 2014, with regular weekly virtual meetings and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.icann.org/x/8CLxAg&quot;&gt;face-to-face meeting at ICANN 51&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, California. In addition to ICANN supported regular weekly CWG virtual meetings, and at the request of the Chairs, ICANN agreed to support a two-full-day &lt;a href=&quot;/news/announcement-2-2014-11-20-en&quot;&gt;face-to-face meeting in Frankfurt, Germany&lt;/a&gt; on 19-20 November 2014 to advance the work of the CWG. On 1 December, the CWG published its draft proposal for a 21-day public comment period. Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.icann.org/download/attachments/50823498/CWG-Dec01PublicConsultFINAL.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1417638162000&amp;api=v2&quot;&gt;publication of the draft proposal&lt;/a&gt; [PDF, 1.7 MB], between 4 &amp;ndash; 6 December, the CWG hosted 3 public webinars to present the draft proposal and engage with the broader community. The next &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.icann.org/display/gnsocwgdtstwrdshp/Meetings&quot;&gt;CWG working meeting&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for &lt;strong&gt;15 January from 14:00-16:00 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CWG consists 131 people, organized as 19 members, appointed by and accountable to chartering organizations, and 112 participants, who participate as individuals. The CWG is an open group: anyone interested in the work of the CWG, can join as a participant. Participants may be from a chartering organization, from a stakeholder group or organization not represented in the CWG or currently active within ICANN, or self-appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 131 CWG members and participants, the regional representation is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;46 Asia/Asia Pacific&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;35 Europe&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Experienced Technology Leader Named as ICANN President and CEO</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2016-02-08-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GÃ¶ran Marby, an experienced business executive and government leader, has been named the next President and Chief Executive Officer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm delighted to announce GÃ¶ran as the new head of ICANN,&quot; said Dr. Stephen Crocker, Chair of the ICANN Board of Directors. &quot;His leadership experience as a technology CEO and start-up founder, as well as his current experience as Director-General of the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority, will be invaluable as ICANN moves towards the next chapter in its history. We conducted an extensive, global search, and GÃ¶ran impressed us all throughout with his shared values, operational experience and understanding of the Internet ecosystem. I'm looking forward to working with him and what I know will be his substantial contribution to ICANN and to helping ensure a stable, secure and unified global Internet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marby is a Swedish citizen, currently living in Stockholm. He and his family will be relocating to Los Angeles, California, the location of one of ICANN's three global hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am very excited to be joining ICANN and joining at the start of a new era for the organization and the community,&quot; said Marby. &quot;While I know there is much for me to learn, I am eager to work with ICANN's multistakeholder community to continue all the good work that ICANN has been doing and am very committed to implementing the community's decisions &amp;ndash; both with respect to the IANA Stewardship Transition, but also in the myriad important areas of ICANN policy development as it fulfills its mission.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marby will succeed current President and CEO Fadi ChehadÃ© whose term finishes on March 15, 2016. Marby will join ICANN in May 2016. During this time, Akram Atallah, President of ICANN's Global Domains Division will serve as acting CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am very grateful to Akram for agreeing to step into this role and providing the continuity and leadership ICANN needs at such an important time,&quot; said Dr Crocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GÃ¶ran Marby has more than 20 years of experience in the Internet and technology sectors. Prior to joining PTS he co-founded AppGate Network Security AB a security software company where he served as CEO between 2002 and 2009 with a focus on international customers and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has held several other leadership roles in the Internet and technology sectors including as CEO of Cygate, a network services company, Country Manager for Cisco in Sweden and as CEO of Unisource Business Networks in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marby holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ICANN Announces Senior Leader Transitions</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2016-05-13-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today announced its Chief Contract Compliance Officer, Allen R. Grogan, and Nora Abusitta, Senior Vice President of Development and Public Responsibility Programs (DPRD), have notified the organization of their intent to leave ICANN later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grogan will transition to a part-time role beginning 1 August 2016 and continue to oversee Contractual Compliance and Consumer Safeguards until his departure at the end of December 2016. Abusitta will remain in her current capacity until 1 June 2016, followed by a short part-time engagement period to ensure an efficient and seamless shift of duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to extend my deep thanks to Allen and Nora for the significant contributions they have made in their respective areas, as well as their commitment to ensuring a smooth transition of responsibilities,&quot; said Akram Atallah, acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO). &quot;Compliance, safeguards and public responsibility are areas of extreme importance to ICANN, to me personally, and to GÃ¶ran Marby, who will be taking the reins as CEO later this month. We will continue to build on the work that has been done in these critical areas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atallah further noted that &quot;ICANN remains fully committed to enforcing its contracts and engaging with the community to help find creative ways to solve difficult issues in a manner consistent with ICANN's mission and remit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grogan has been with ICANN since May 2013, serving as Chief Contracting Counsel before assuming his current role as Chief Contract Compliance Officer in October 2014. ICANN is currently searching for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://icann-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.jobInfo&amp;version=1&amp;jobid=213889&quot;&gt;Consumer Safeguards Director&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My decision to leave was highly personal and difficult, but it will allow me to pursue other opportunities in my life,&quot; said Grogan. &quot;It has been a privilege to work with the dedicated staff at ICANN and I specifically want to commend the Contractual Compliance team for their extraordinary work. My time at ICANN genuinely has been one of the most fascinating and remarkable experiences I've ever had.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abusitta joined ICANN in January 2013 as Executive Director of International and Inter-Governmental Organizations and in June of that year was appointed Vice President of Public Responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has been an honor to work alongside dedicated and talented colleagues at ICANN, in particular the members of DPRD who were instrumental in building an infrastructure that empowers the community while ensuring participation within ICANN remains global and representative,&quot; said Abusitta. &quot;This has not been an easy decision for me, but I am confident the ICANN staff will continue to focus on supporting current and new stakeholders' participation at ICANN.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ICANN's mission is to help ensure a stable, secure and unified global Internet. To reach another person on the Internet, you have to type an address into your computer - a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN helps coordinate and support these unique identifiers across the world. ICANN was formed in 1998 as a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation and a community with participants from all over the world. ICANN and its community help keep the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It also promotes competition and develops policy for the top-level of the Internet's naming system and facilitates the use of other unique Internet identifiers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matt Larson, an expert in Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure and security, has joined the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as Vice President of Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are incredibly excited to have Matt on our team,&quot; said David Conrad, Chief Technology Officer. &quot;An industry veteran, he brings to ICANN over twenty-five years of experience in designing and operating critical DNS architecture and developing and implementing innovative research programs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has written three books on the DNS, including &lt;em&gt;DNS on Windows Server 2003 and DNS on Windows&lt;/em&gt;, and is a co-host of the &quot;Ask Mr. DNS Podcast&quot;.

      <title>2016 Multistakeholder Ethos Award Recognizes Two Members of the Global Internet Community</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2016-06-27-en</link>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;floatcenter&quot; style=&quot;width: 750px;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/sites/default/files/assets/multistakeholder-ethos-award-recognizes-two-members-750x425-27jun16-en.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/assets/multistakeholder-ethos-award-recognizes-two-members-750x425-27jun16-en.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 750px;&quot; alt=&quot;2016 Multistakeholder Ethos Award Recognizes Two Members of the Global Internet Community&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN is pleased to announce the recipients of the 2016 Multistakeholder Ethos Award. This year, the community evaluation panel recognized two long-time members of the ICANN community: &lt;strong&gt;Chuck Gomes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Keith Davidson&lt;/strong&gt;. The awards were presented today at ICANN56 in Helsinki, Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Multistakeholder Ethos Award honors members of the ICANN community who have made outstanding contributions to ICANN's multistakeholder model of Internet governance. Chuck Gomes and Keith Davidson were selected from a list of 19 nominees as those who best demonstrated the spirit of collaboration with the aim of building consensus. These recipients have proven their dedication to ICANN's multistakeholder model through many years of active participation and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community panel felt that each recipient met the award criteria in distinctive ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Gomes, based in North America, was recognized for his passionate advocacy of the multistakeholder model. On a day-to-day basis, he exhibits the qualities of a facilitator, collaborator and consensus builder, working beyond the boundaries of any constituency or stakeholder group. Gomes served as the first Chair of the Registry Stakeholders Group, and was instrumental in its development. He has volunteered his time and services to many working groups within the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO), where he also served as GNSO Councilor, including terms as Chair and Vice Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Gomes contributed significantly to the Internet Assigned Names Authority (IANA) Stewardship Transition, acting as a liaison between the two cross-community working groups: CWG-Stewardship and CCWG-Accountability. He is the current Chair of the Next Generation Registration Directory Services Policy Development Process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's Keith Davidson is recognized for his many years of commitment to ICANN's multistakeholder model. Davidson served as Vice Chair of the Country Codes Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) Council and Co-Chair of the ccNSO/Governmental Advisory Committee Liaison Group. Recently, he represented the ccNSO on the Meetings Strategy Working Group. Other leadership roles include acting as Chair of the Delegation and Redelegation Working Group and the Framework of Interpretation Working Group. Throughout, Davidson has demonstrated a commitment to consensus building and to ICANN's multistakeholder processes that is truly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davidson's influence has extended to the larger Internet ecosystem, particularly in New Zealand. Over many years, he acted as Director and Chair of the Asia Pacific Top Level Domain Name Association (APTLD), as the driving force behind the Pacific Internet Governance Forum, as trustee of the Internet Society and as President of InternetNZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2014 at ICANN50 in London, the Multistakeholder Ethos Award recognizes ICANN participants who have invested in consensus-based solutions, acknowledged the importance of ICANN's multistakeholder model of Internet governance and contributed in a substantive way to the higher interests of ICANN's organization and community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Registration Data Directory Services Consistent Labeling and Display Policy Available for Public Comment</title>
      <link>http://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2016-10-21-en</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES â 21 October 2016 â The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) today issued a call for public comment on a revised version of the Registry Registration Data Directory Services Consistent Labeling and Display Policy. Comments will be accepted until 23:59 UTC on 12 December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/public-comments/rdds-labeling-display-2016-10-21-en&quot;&gt;Comment on the policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy, which was published for implementation on 26 July 2016, has been rescinded. It will no longer take effect on 1 February 2017, as originally scheduled. ICANN intends to consider all comments on the revised version and then issue a new policy and effective date in the first quarter of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the revised version of the Registry Registration Data Directory Services Consistent Labeling and Display Policy, ICANN has removed language that requires registries to implement the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP). The protocol will be mandated through contractual agreement rather than through consensus policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About ICANN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ICANN's mission is to help ensure a stable, secure and unified global Internet. To reach another person on the Internet, you have to type an address into your computer - a name or a number. That address has to be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN helps coordinate and support these unique identifiers across the world. ICANN was formed in 1998 as a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation and a community with participants from all over the world. ICANN and its community help keep the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It also promotes competition and develops policy for the top-level of the Internet's naming system and facilitates the use of other unique Internet identifiers.
